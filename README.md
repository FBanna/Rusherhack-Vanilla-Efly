Highly customizable options allowing for 40-40 pitch, and much more, or even (mostly in laggy situations) climb to 1000+ blocks at 90 degrees with fireworks then drift down at 5 degrees, allowing for thousands of blocks to be covered at a desired speed to distance ratio. 

Also has an auto firework mode that climbs to correct height and waits there till firework boost ends (stops speed being lost on the way down and reduces use of firework on next cycle).

Has a 2B2T mode, only really necessary when climbing at 90 degrees up to 1000+ blocks, works by wiggling the pitch back and fourth by a set amount.
